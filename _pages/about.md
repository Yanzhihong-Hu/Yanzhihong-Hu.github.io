I am a Juninor student of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign maijoring in Mathematics, my research interests generally about Geometry, Topology and Alegbraic Geometry. I am good at dealing with mathematical topics that combine Geometry with Algebra.

Research Experience
======
1. Research about Poisson structures and their cohomology mentored by Florian Zeiser. (Jan 2024-Present)

The goal of this project is to understand the underlying foliation, infinitesimal automorphisms and deformations by means of the associated cohomology groups, i.e. Poisson cohomology, for some of the linear Poisson brackets.
1. Reading course about several articles by Kawauch Akio mentored by Igor Mineyev (Jan 2024-Present)

The goal is try to understand the proof of several long-standing open problems in topology/geometric group theory solved by Kawauchi Akio, and try to find mistakes, if any.
1. Reseach about Linear Poisson structures in dimension 4 mentored by Florian Zeiser. (Aug 2023-Dec 2023)

The goal of this project is to understand, on a formal level, the underlying foliation, infinitesimal automorphisms and deformations by means of the associated cohomology groups, i.e. formal Poisson cohomology, for some of the linear Poisson brackets.

Courses
======
1. Undergraduate course:
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
