I am a Senior student of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign maijoring in Mathe-
matics, my research interests focus on low-dimensional topology and geometric group
theory. I am good at dealing with mathematical topics that combine Geometry with Algebra

Research Experience
======
1. Reading Course Supervised by Jake Rasmussen about 4-Manifolds and Kirby Calcu-
lus 
Mar 2024-present \
• Generally follow the book 4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus, learning the theory
about handle decomposition, Heegaard splitting and Kirby diagrams etc.
• Now planning to learn the things toward h-corbodism theorm.
1. Research Project Supervised by Igor Mineyev about Unknotting Conjecture and White-
head Conjecture
Jan 2024-present \
• Follow several articles by Akio Kawauchi that claim to have solved several long-
standing open problems in topology/geometric group theory. Which include Un-
knotting Conjecture and Whitehead Conjecture. And try to determine whether the
results are true and try to make it more concise and shorter.
• Now we are planning to figure out the proof of free-ribbon Lemma which can be
used to prove whitehead conjecture.
1. Polymath REU Supervised by Alex Zupan and Jeffrey Meier
May 2024- Aug 2024 \
• In the project, we examine connections between the minimal number of self-intersections
in any ribbon disk bounded by a ribbon knot K, called the ribbon number of K, and
other knot invariants, such as the knot determinant and Alexander polynomial of K.
Schedule
• More concise, our team has tried to characterize Symmetrically Maximal Ribbon
Knots and to figure out can the difference between the symmetric ribbon number
and the ribbon number can be arbitrarily large.
• For the first question we use union presentation and partial diagram and Christoph
Lemma and for the second question we try to break ribbon disks into ekementray
pieces.
1. Geodesics on integral affine manifolds mentored by Florian Zeiser.
June 2024- July 2024 \
• In this project we study the geodesics associated to the connections on integral
affine manifolds in dimension 2. We first recall the necessary theory for manifolds,
before focusing on integral affine manifolds and their special properties. And we
also investigated such manifolds in dimension 3.
1. Research project about Poisson structures and their cohomology mentored by Florian
Zeiser.
(Jan 2024- May 2024) \
• In this project we understand the underlying foliation, infinitesimal automorphisms
and deformations by means of the associated cohomology groups, i.e. Poisson
cohomology, for some of the linear Poisson brackets.
1. Research project Linear Poisson structures in dimension 4 and their cohomolog men-
tored by Florian Zeiser.
Aug 2023- Dec 2023 \
• In this project we understand the underlying foliation, infinitesimal automorphisms
and deformations by means of the associated cohomology groups, i.e. formal
Poisson cohomology, for some of the linear Poisson brackets.
